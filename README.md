### BlinkIt_Analysis
 
## Problem Statement
At Blinkit, understanding the sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution is crucial for making data-driven decisions and improving operational efficiency. The company needed a comprehensive analytical dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and highlight business opportunities.

## Task 
My task was to build an interactive Power BI dashboard to:

 1. Track total and average sales.
 2. Analyze customer ratings.
 3. Understand item type and fat content performance.
 4. Explore the influence of outlet size, type, and location on sales.

This involved handling raw data, transforming it, and delivering insightful visualizations for business stakeholders.

## Action 
To achieve this, I followed a structured approach:
 1. Requirement Gathering: Understood stakeholder needs like KPIs and chart types.
 2. Data Walkthrough: Explored the data, identified important columns, and understood relationships.
 3. Data Cleaning & Quality Check: Cleaned inconsistencies in fat content, item types, outlet info, etc.
 4. Data Modeling: Created relationships and hierarchies to enable drill-down analysis.
 5. DAX Calculations: Built custom measures like total sales, average rating, number of items sold, and more.

## Dashboard Development:

 1. Used donut charts for fat content and outlet size analysis.
 2. Bar and column charts for item types and outlet comparisons.
 3. A line chart for establishment trends.
 4. A funnel map for geographic distribution.
 5. A matrix card to consolidate key metrics by outlet type.

## Result 
The final dashboard provided a clear and interactive view of Blinkitâ€™s performance, enabling business users to:

 1. Identify top-performing items and outlet types.
 2. Understand sales patterns across fat content and regions.
 3. Recognize underperforming outlets and products needing attention.
 4. It helped in data-driven decision making, enhanced reporting efficiency, and offered actionable insights for marketing and inventory strategies.
